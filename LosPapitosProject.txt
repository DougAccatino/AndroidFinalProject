The Project
Same idea from Hackathon
    An Android app that helps with severe natural disaster situations. Upon installation, the 
    app will ask the user for explicit permission to use the device location. After this, there 
    will be a typical user sign up/register application. The app will then go to the main screen,
    which will seem very simple, as it will just be a 'breathing' logo, that will be searching for
    severe weather conditions in the devices location. The app will use the Google-maps-api, and 
    here.com's severe-weather-api. The location will be obtained from the Google-Maps-API and
    then given to the severe-weather-api. If there is severe weather in the devices location, 
    a notification/alert will occur no matter what app the user has open. The notification will
    ask "Are you safe?" with a yes or no option. If yes is selected, then nothing happens. If no is
    selected, then an emergency signal will be sent out to emergency services/or our backend servers
    to help first responders find those in need. If no answer is selecte, the a signal will be sent out
    anyway.
